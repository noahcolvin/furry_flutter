# Furry Backend - dotnet
This is a sample mobile app named `Furry`, a (very) basic pet store. This is not intended to be a complete application, but rather a starting point for a full application.

Created using Flutter and Riverpod.

## Features
- Dashboard page
- List of store items with filtering
- Item detail page
- Cart page
- Item search

## How to run
[Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) for your platform of choice.

The backend is not included in this repository. That will be available separately.

```bash
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run
```

## Running Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

## Questions
#### What is the purpose of this project?
I created this project to demonstrate creating a simple mobile app in Flutter.

#### Why isn't there much here?
This is just a starting point. I wanted to keep it simple and not include too many features. This is a good starting point for a full application.

#### Where is the backend?
This will be available shortly.

#### Why is there no authentication?
No need for the current app.

#### Code X is bad, why didn't you do Y?
This is just a sample exercise and was completed in a few days. I'm sure there are many improvements that could be made. Fell free to make an issue or PR if you have a suggestion. This doesn't need to be perfect but I am certainly open to feedback. I may add to it in the future.
